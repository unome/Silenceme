\f0\fs24 \cf0 Do you constantly keep forgetting to put your phone on silent during a class or meeting or god forbid an interview. And do you keep forgetting to set back the ringer after setting it to silent.Well you do not have to worry anymore , with the help of this nifty application.\
SilenceMe monitors your calendar to set your phone in silent whenever there is an event happening on your calendar and set back the ringer once the event is finished. The monitoring can be customized with adding keywords ,such that if the keyword occurs in the title of the event, the phone will be silenced , else not. There is also an option to silence the phone during all the events irrespective of the keywords.It is a simple and an intuitive app.\
The application is still in beta and hence any request for new features or problems can be sent to the address com.unome@gmail.com. If the app crashes, we request you to provide the series of steps that lead to the crash.}
